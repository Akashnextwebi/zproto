                    <h2>10. Payments and Billing.</h2>
                    <p>
                        Certain Services of ours may be subject to payments now or in the future (“Paid 
Services”). Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process 
of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms and 
Conditions. We use a third-party payment processor (“Payment Processor”) to 
bill you through a payment account linked to your Account on the Services (“Billing 
Account”) for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject 
to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition 
to these Terms and Conditions. We are not responsible for error by the Payment 
Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the 
Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such 
Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize 
us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your 
“Payment Method”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment 
Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even 
if it has already requested or received payment. The terms of your payment will be 
based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between 
you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen 
Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment 
from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand. 
YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE 
INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY 
UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, 
COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, 
CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU 
MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR 
PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU 
BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE 
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR 
PASSWORD. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING 
INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU 
FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT 
UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH 
ABOVE. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount 
you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of 
sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the 
amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the 
transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your 
use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred 
and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each 
billing cycle. Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service 
must be used within the specified time of the trial.

representatives from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including reasonable 
attorneys’ fees, that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of, or access to, the

person or entity. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control
